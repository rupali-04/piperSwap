# piperSwap
Decentralized Exchange Application 

Welcome to PiperSwap this is an ongoing Project by Team Piped-piper for DecentralHacks 2021.

1. This Project is built with Truffle, Web3.js, Solidity, and Javascript.
2. We have used Rinkeby TestNet to Deploy our Project in Ethereum Blockchain.

Working State of the Project: We have created an ERC20 Token PiperToken, and we are using Dai Stablecoin to swap Dai for Pipertoken.

Future Plans of the Project: We are going to use 1inch Protocol so that we can set a Limit order on the Token we have received from the Investor
and swap the Dai Stablecoin to WETH.
